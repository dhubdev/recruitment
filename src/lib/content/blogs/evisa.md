🎓 **From Visa Decision to Confirmation of Immigration Status in the UK**  
From **15 July 2025**, the UK fully transitioned to issuing **eVisas**—a digital, passport-linked record—replacing physical stickers and BRPs for most new student visas :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## ✅ What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Create a UKVI Account  
Set up a UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI) account immediately after receiving your visa decision.  
You’ll need:
- A valid passport and either your visa application number (GWF/UAN) or BRP number  
- An email address, phone number, and smartphone for ID verification using the **UK Immigration: ID Check** app :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### 2. Confirm Identity & Link Your Passport  
Log in, link your passport via the ID Check app (or BRP if still valid), and submit your identity scan.  
Once approved, your passport will be digitally linked to your **eVisa** in your UKVI account :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

### 3. Preview Your eVisa  
Verify all personal details—name, date of birth, nationality, document expiry—match your travel documents before departure :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

### 4. Generate a Share Code  
Use the **"View and Prove Immigration Status"** tool to create a share code for use by universities, employers, or border officials. Codes are valid for 90 days and can be re-generated as needed :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

### 5. Carry Your Passport + Share Code (and BRP if held until March 2025)  
Even if you previously received a BRP or vignette, budget to keep it until **31 March 2025**, as expired physical documents remain accepted until then :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

### 6. Update Your Details Immediately  
If you change your passport, name, address, or contact info, log into UKVI and update promptly to avoid mismatches or travel complications :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

### 7. At UK Arrival & During Enrolment  
Bring your passport + share code, and any valid BRP/vignette. Universities will conduct Right‑to‑Study checks using your eVisa (via share code) or physical document if still valid :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
