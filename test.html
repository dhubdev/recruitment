Requirements:
1. Every **section must begin** with a heading tag ('<h2>', '<h3>', or '<h4>' depending on context).
2. The **heading tag must have an id** that is a URL-friendly slug of its text content (e.g., "Privacy Policy" becomes 'id="privacy-policy"').
3. Do **not** use '<strong>' or other inline tags to simulate section headings — **only use real heading tags** ('<h2>'–'<h4>') for titles or subtitles.
4. Use appropriate HTML tags for content like '<p>', '<ul>', '<ol>', '<table>', and '<code>' as needed.
5. The output must be wrapped in a single '<section>' or a set of semantic '<section>' tags.
6. The output must be pure HTML. Do not include any Markdown or commentary.
